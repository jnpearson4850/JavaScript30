# Flex Panel!



 My task is to build a css mockup with Flex Panels using Wes Bos Javascript 30 tutorial.  

 

## Code provided by Wes Bos



-   Basic HTML

-   Basic CSS styling 







## My Requirements



To create a web page that had fully functional CSS flex boxes as well as text that moved in an out of the frame depending on the state of the box it was in. 



## Method of Completion



This was an awesome intro to Flex-Box and additional features that are used with plain CSS. I accomplished my requirements by creating a panel class and placing my "transition" feature into it. Added Javascript to toggle the panels and placed the panels in "children" and "parent" roles to scale to one another.  



In conclusion this was a great started project for gaining knowledge on CSS as well as creating a web design using a tutorial.
